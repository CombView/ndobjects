## Non-Deterministic Objects (CombView API)

We don't need much for a practical non-deterministic programming: please 
welcome to `ndobjects`, a minimalist library implementation for `combview` language.

Note that we have plans to extend this to other languages, but focus will be on C++ until we get
a complete usable library.
